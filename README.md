# Linear Algebra for AI â€“ Intuition and Concepts
=================================================

## Overview
--------------
This project is a **comprehensive summary of Linear Algebra** with a focus on **intuition and understanding the meaning of concepts**, rather than just formulas.  
It is designed for anyone interested in applying linear algebra to **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Goals
---------
- Focus on **understanding concepts** rather than memorizing formulas.  
- Build a **solid foundation for AI and Machine Learning**.  
- Provide **visual examples and code snippets** for better intuition.  
- Serve as a **personal reference for linear algebra in AI projects**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Features
----------------
- **Vectors and Vector Spaces**  
  Understanding vectors, operations, and their geometric interpretations.

- **Matrices and Matrix Operations**  
  Addition, multiplication, transpose, inverse, and their meaning in transformations.

- **Linear Transformations**  
  How matrices can transform vectors and spaces, with visual intuition.

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**  
  Conceptual understanding and their role in dimensionality reduction, PCA, and AI applications.

- **Orthogonality and Projections**  
  Understanding orthogonal vectors, orthonormal bases, and projecting vectors in space.

- **Change of Basis**  
  How to represent vectors in different coordinate systems.

- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
  Intuition behind decomposing a matrix into meaningful components.
